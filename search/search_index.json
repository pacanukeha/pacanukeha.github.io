He wears a small ankh-crucifix on a black headband. Black Shoes, Black pants with the lower leg wrapped in Silver trimmed Black cloth. Short Black Hooded Robe with neck-wrap/mask and elbow length sleeves and silver trimmed black cloth wrapped arms.</p> <p>Akio carries a spear on his back and twin daggers on his wrists and two more on his belt.</p> <p>History Born and raised in the Slums of Farris. His father died in a construction accident on the Wharf when he was 4. Leaving him and his mother alone. His mother worked in a tannery and young Akio fell into thievery to help out. At age 6 he stole the purse of the tanner who was forcing his mother to provide him \"additional services\". The man saw him and though he had no idea who his mother was, he fled the city and found himself lost in Moonsilver forest. He was found by an elven hermit. He stayed with the hermit who revealed himself to be a wardancer from a forest clan. Impressed with Akios ability, the elf trained him in the ways of the wardancer.  </p> <p>12 years later, the old elf declared he needed to go on a pilgrimage and would be gone for many many decades and so it was time for Akio to find his own journey. Akio sat on a tree branch meditating on this when a vision came to him. The city by the Spire, Ptolus.  </p> <p>Akio bid his master good journey and left the next day for the legendary City. There are many shadows in Ptolus and many evils lurk in them. Time to remind the forces of darkness that they do not own the night.</p>"},{"location":"PCs/Baden%20Brighthammer/","title":"Baden Brighthammer","text":""},{"location":"PCs/Borin%20Brighthammer/","title":"Borin Brighthammer","text":"<p>Dwarf \u2013 Cleric \u2013 1 i got nuthin</p>"},{"location":"PCs/Cassian/","title":"Cassian","text":"<p>Human \u2013 Sorcerer \u2013 Clockwork \u2013 1 Cassian Shever Scion of the black sheep branch of the Noble House of Shever </p>"},{"location":"PCs/Nox/","title":"Nox","text":"<p>Human \u2012 Ranger \u2012 Gloomstalker \u2012 1</p> <p>Orphaned at a young age after a particularly cruel winter, Nox lived in the wilderness and outskirts of towns. He lived off the land and occasionally supplemented his meagre catch thru theft of minor items from farmers and travellers.  As he became older, perhaps in an effort to live a less solitary existence, Nox ventured into the local city \u2012 Trolone. Nox has spent the last few seasons in the city living in the shadows, alleys, and rooftops of the slums.</p> <p>Nox stands 5'11\" with light brown hair and grey eyes. He is perhaps 17 years old , with the appearance of someone who has reached their full height but not gained the weight to match.  He is exceedingly quick, with precise economy to his movements belying\u00a0his gangly appearance. </p> <p>While not unattractive Nox is unfailingly blunt, avoids eye contact, and is perhaps a bit feral.\u00a0By contrast he is shrewd and street smart, having honed strong survival instincts.\u00a0</p> <p>Although he had no concrete evidence, those instincts are telling him that he had overstayed his welcome in the city and when the opportunity to move on in comparative luxury he grasped it with both hands.</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""}]}
