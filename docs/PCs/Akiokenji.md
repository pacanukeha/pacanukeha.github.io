**History**
Born and raised in the Slums of Farris. His father died in a construction accident on the Wharf when he was 4. Leaving him and his mother alone. His mother worked in a tannery and young Akio fell into thievery to help out. At age 6 he stole the purse of the tanner who was forcing his mother to provide him "additional services". The man saw him and though he had no idea who his mother was, he fled the city and found himself lost in Moonsilver forest. He was found by an elven hermit. He stayed with the hermit who revealed himself to be a wardancer from a forest clan. Impressed with Akios ability, the elf trained him in the ways of the wardancer.  
  
12 years later, the old elf declared he needed to go on a pilgrimage and would be gone for many many decades and so it was time for Akio to find his own journey. Akio sat on a tree branch meditating on this when a vision came to him. The city by the Spire, Ptolus.  
  
 Akio bid his master good journey and left the next day for the legendary City. There are many shadows in Ptolus and many evils lurk in them. Time to remind the forces of darkness that they do not own the night.
