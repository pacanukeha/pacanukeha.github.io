Human ‒ Ranger ‒ Gloomstalker ‒ 1

Orphaned at a young age after a particularly cruel winter, Nox lived in the wilderness and outskirts of towns. He lived off the land and occasionally supplemented his meagre catch thru theft of minor items from farmers and travellers.  As he became older, perhaps in an effort to live a less solitary existence, Nox ventured into the local city ‒ Trolone. Nox has spent the last few seasons in the city living in the shadows, alleys, and rooftops of the slums.

Nox stands 5'11" with light brown hair and grey eyes. He is perhaps 17 years old , with the appearance of someone who has reached their full height but not gained the weight to match.  He is exceedingly quick, with precise economy to his movements belying his gangly appearance. 

While not unattractive Nox is unfailingly blunt, avoids eye contact, and is perhaps a bit feral. By contrast he is shrewd and street smart, having honed strong survival instincts. 

Although he had no concrete evidence, those instincts are telling him that he had overstayed his welcome in the city and when the opportunity to move on in comparative luxury he grasped it with both hands.
